# Create a Budget GCP Project
Create a project to host our infrastructure.  

[![Open this project in Cloud Shell](http://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.png)](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?git_repo=https://github.com/nufailtd/terraform-budget-gcp&open_in_editor=main.tf&cloudshell_workspace=budget_gcp_project)



Create a `terraform.tfvars` files in this directory by running  
```
./create-tfvars.sh myproject
```
Example;
```
user@cloudshell:~/terraform-budget-gcp/budget_gcp_project$ ./create-tfvars.sh myproject

## This section has been auto-generated by ./create-tfvars.sh  ##
email           = "user@gmail.com"
billing_account = "02E280-9E2C47-1DF365"
name            = "myproject"
## This section has been auto-generated by ./create-tfvars.sh  ##
```
You may also create the file `terraform.tfvars` yourself and add  the following required variables;

```
email                       = "user@gmail.com"
billing_account             = "02E280-9E2C47-1DF365"
name                        = "myproject"
```
The above values are just examples, use your own.  
If you encounter this error  
`Error: error creating project myproject (myproject): googleapi: Error 409: Requested entity already exists, alreadyExists`  
you will need to change the name or delete to auto-generate.  
Do **not** set any optional variables if you do not have them.  
Run the following commands

- `terraform init` to get the plugins
- `terraform plan` to see the infrastructure plan
- `terraform apply --auto-approve` to apply the infrastructure build  
Example output
```
Apply complete! Resources: 56 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

billing_account = 02E280-9E2C47-1DF365
org_id = 
project_bucket_url = [
  "gs://myproject-state",
]
project_id = myproject
project_name = myproject
project_number = 1039118523779
service_account_email = project-service-account@myproject.iam.gserviceaccount.com
service_account_id = project-service-account
service_account_name = projects/myproject/serviceAccounts/project-service-account@myproject.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```
