# Terraform Budget GCP

These modules create infrastructure on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that can be run for less than **10$** a month.( *YMMV*)
This repo contains instructions on how to actually create these resources.
Read the [companion article](../../../budget-gcp) to understand what choices were made to cut costs.

It guides on how to create all the resources plus pre-requisites from scratch.  
Resources created  include;

- A Domain Name using Freenom
- A GCP Organization
- A GCP Seed Project from which other projects will be created.
- A GCP Project for our resources.
- A GKE Private Cluster.
- A Google Container Instance running Traefik.
- A Google CloudRun Service running Vault.


## Compatibility

 This module is meant for use with Terraform 0.12. 

## Requirements
* A Domain Name.
* A Google Cloud Platform Account.
* A Valid Debit or Credit Card to enable billing.

### Create the GCP Seed Project

Create a file `terraform.tfvars` with the following content from the steps completed above;

```
org_id                  = "<ORGANIZATION_ID>"

billing_account         = "<BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID>"

group_org_admins        = "<admin@domain>"

group_billing_admins    = "<billing@domain>"

default_region          = "us-central1"

sa_enable_impersonation = true

```

Then perform the following commands on the seed_project folder:

- `terraform init` to get the plugins
- `terraform plan` to see the infrastructure plan
- `terraform apply` to apply the infrastructure build
#### File structure
This module has the following folders and files:
```
- /seed_project/: root folder
- /seed_project/main.tf: main file for this module, creates the project's resources
- /seed_project/tfvars.example: an example of a file to generate terraform.tfvars
- /seed_project/variables.tf: all the variables for the module
- /seed_project/output.tf: the outputs of the module
- /seed_project/README.md: information about the module
```

### Create the GCP Project
Create a file `terraform.tfvars` with the following content;

```
org_id                      = "<ORGANIZATION_ID>"
billing_account             = "<BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID>"
group_org_admins            = "<admin@domain>"
impersonate_service_account = "<seed_project service account>"
name                        = "<project_name>"
bucket_project              = "<project_bucket_name>"
default_region              = "us-central1"
```

### Create resources in the GCP Project
Create a file `terraform.tfvars` with the following content;

```
project_id       = "<project_name>"
region           = "us-central1"
zones            = ["us-central1-a"]
cluster_name     = "kluster"
domain           = "<your domain>"
domain_filter    = "<your domain>"
run_post_install = false
email            = "<your email>"
dns_auth              = [
    {
      name = "provider"
      value = "google"
     }
  ]
# OIDC Configuration
oidc_config           = [
    {
      name = "authenticate.idp.provider"
      value = "google"
     },
    {
      name = "authenticate.idp.clientID"
      value = "[project_id]-[hash].apps.googleusercontent.com"
    },
    {
      name = "authenticate.idp.clientSecret"
      value = "mysecret"
    }
  ]
```

Then perform the following commands on the kluster_project folder:

- `terraform init` to get the plugins
- `terraform plan` to see the infrastructure plan
- `terraform apply` to apply the infrastructure build

**Important!!**
Once completed modify `terraform.tfvars` and set
```
run_post_install = true
```
Then perform the following commands:

- `terraform init` to get the plugins
- `terraform plan` to see the infrastructure plan
- `terraform apply` to apply the infrastructure build
We do this in 2 steps because of some limitations in terraform that will cause an error if certain resources do not exist.

To delete the projects and stop charges accruing to your account run

- `terraform destroy` to destroy the built infrastructure
#### File structure
The project has the following folders and files:
```
- /: root folder
- /modules/cert/: - creates certificated for our domain.
- /modules/cloud-run/: creates a ghost blog cloudrun service
- /modules/custom-nat/: creates an internet gateway for our private cluster

- /modules/vault-cloud-run/: creates a vault application running in cloudrun
- /modules/vault-sa/: creates a kubernetes service account to be used by the vault application
