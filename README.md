# Terraform Budget GCP

These modules create infrastructure on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that can be run for less than **10$** a month.( *[YMMV](https://nufailtd.github.io/budget-gcp/)* )
This repo contains instructions on how to actually create these resources.
Read the [companion article](https://nufailtd.github.io/budget-gcp/) to understand what choices were made to cut costs.

It guides on how to create all the resources plus pre-requisites from scratch.  
Resources created  include;

- A Domain Name using Freenom
- A GCP Organization
- A GCP Seed Project from which other projects will be created.
- A GCP Project for our resources.
- A GKE Private Cluster.
- A Google Container Instance running Traefik.
- A Google CloudRun Service running Vault.


## Compatibility

 This module is meant for use with Terraform 0.12. 

## Requirements
* A Domain Name.
* A Google Cloud Platform Account.
* A Valid Debit or Credit Card to enable billing.

### Create the GCP Seed Project
**Please skip** this for now and return when/if you successfully create an organization.  
We are able to deploy our resources without it. 
<details>
  <summary>Click to show</summary>

Switch to the `seed_project` folder;  
```
cd ~/cloudshell_open/terraform-budget-gcp/seed_project
```

Create a file `terraform.tfvars` with the following information from the organization you just created;

```
org_id                  = "<ORGANIZATION_ID>"

billing_account         = "<BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID>"

group_org_admins        = "<admin@domain.com>"

group_billing_admins    = "<billing@domain.com>"

default_region          = "us-central1"

sa_enable_impersonation = true
```


Then perform the following commands:

- `terraform init` - to get the plugins
```
you@cloudshell:~/cloudshell_open/terraform-budget-gcp/seed_project$ terraform init
```
- `terraform plan` - to see the infrastructure plan
```
you@cloudshell:~/cloudshell_open/terraform-budget-gcp/seed_project$ terraform plan
```
 - `terraform apply --auto-approve` - to apply the infrastructure build
```
you@cloudshell:~/cloudshell_open/terraform-budget-gcp/seed_project$ terraform apply --auto-approve
```

</details>

---

### Create the GCP Project


Switch to the `budget_gcp_project` folder;  
```
cd ~/cloudshell_open/terraform-budget-gcp/budget_gcp_project
```

Create a `terraform.tfvars` file in the `budget_gcp_project` directory by running  
```
./create-tfvars.sh myproject
```
Example;
```
user@cloudshell:~/cloudshell_open/terraform-budget-gcp/budget_gcp_project$ ./create-tfvars.sh myproject

## This section has been auto-generated by ./create-tfvars.sh  ##
email           = "user@gmail.com"
billing_account = "02E280-9E2C47-1DF365"
name            = "myproject"
## This section has been auto-generated by ./create-tfvars.sh  ##
```

Then perform the following commands:

- `terraform init` - to get the plugins
```
you@cloudshell:~/cloudshell_open/terraform-budget-gcp/budget_gcp_project$ terraform init
```
- `terraform plan` - to see the infrastructure plan
```
you@cloudshell:~/cloudshell_open/terraform-budget-gcp/budget_gcp_project$ terraform plan
```
 - `terraform apply --auto-approve` - to apply the infrastructure build
```
you@cloudshell:~/cloudshell_open/terraform-budget-gcp/budget_gcp_project$ terraform apply --auto-approve
```

This operation will output the `project_id` to be used in the next steps.

Before creating our resources it will be convenient to complete the following manual operations.  
This will help us automate the final step.

<a name="create-oauth2-client"></a>
#### **Create an Oauth2 Client in GCP**
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  
1. Log in to your Google Cloud account and go to the [APIs & services](https://console.developers.google.com/projectselector/apis/credentials).
![Select Project](./images/google/01-oauth2-select-project.png)
 Navigate to **Consent** using the left-hand menu and select **External**
![Consent Screen](./images/google/02-oauth2-consent-screen.png)

2. Configure your **Oauth Consent Screen**  
Fill in "Application Name"  
Proceed to next page and under scopes make sure you select the following scopes **only**  
`openid, profile, email`  
![OAuth Consent Scopes ](./images/google/03-oauth2-add-scopes.png)
Add your email as a test user and complete.
![OAuth Consent Add Users](./images/google/04-oauth2-add-users.png)
A successful configuration should like below

![Create New Credentials](./images/google/06-oauth2-create-credentials.png)

4. Configure Client ID  
On the **Create [Client ID]** page, select **Web application**.   
Under **Authorized redirect URIs**
set the following parameters substituting `domain.com` for domain you created above  
`https://authenticate.domain.com/oauth2/callback`  
`https://vault.domain.com/ui/vault/auth/oidc/oidc/callback`  
![Web App Credentials Configuration](./images/google/07-oauth2-configure-application.png)


5. Click **Create** to proceed. The [Client ID] and [Client Secret] settings will be displayed.  

Download the client_secret file to be used in a later configuration.

![Create Zone](./images/dns/01-clouddns-createzone.png)

2. Create New Zone.  
On the **Create a DNS Zone** page, enter a **Zone Name** (a nice approach is to replace the periods in your domain with a dash) then enter the domain you created above in **DNS name**.
![Enter Zone details](./images/dns/02-clouddns-createzone.png)

3. Get Nameservers.  
Nameservers in the format **ns-cloud-xx.googledomains.com** will be presented to you.  
 Take note of them as you will use them in the next step.
![Enter Zone details](./images/dns/03-clouddns-getnameservers.png)

### Create resources in the GCP Project
The variables for this step are derived from the previous steps, namely:
- `oauth2 ClientID`
- `oauth2 ClientSecret`
- `cloudflare Token` (optional)
- `domain`
- `project_id`


Make sure you are in the root folder  
```
cd ~/cloudshell_open/terraform-budget-gcp
```

Create a file `terraform.tfvars` by running the following command;
```
cp tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
```
In your cloud shell editor, open the file `terraform.tfvars` and change the values in `"<>"` to match your values from the previous steps.

```
project_id       = "<project_name>"
region           = "us-central1"
zones            = ["us-central1-a"]
cluster_name     = "kluster"
domain           = "<your domain>"
domain_filter    = "<your domain>"
run_post_install = false
email            = "<your email>"
dns_auth              = [
    {
      name = "provider"
      value = "google"
     }
  ]
# OIDC Configuration
oidc_config           = [
    {
      name = "authenticate.idp.provider"
      value = "google"
     },
    {
      name = "authenticate.idp.clientID"
      value = "<[project_id]-[hash].apps.googleusercontent.com>"
    },
    {
      name = "authenticate.idp.clientSecret"
      value = "<mysecret>"
    },
    {
      name  = "authenticate.idp.url"
      value = "https://accounts.google.com"
    }
  ]
```

Then perform the following commands:  

It is recommended to run this before performing the subsequent commands.  
This ensures that you use the project's service account to create resources. 
The token expires every hour so you'll have to re-issue these command if you get a **not allowed** error.  
Simply run;  
`. ./auth.sh [your_project_id]`;
```
 you@cloudshell:~/cloudshell_open/terraform-budget-gcp$ . ./auth.sh [your_project_id]
```

- `terraform init` - to get the plugins
```
you@cloudshell:~/cloudshell_open/terraform-budget-gcp$ terraform init
```
- `terraform plan` - to see the infrastructure plan
```
you@cloudshell:~/cloudshell_open/terraform-budget-gcp$ terraform plan
```
 - `terraform apply --auto-approve` - to apply the infrastructure build
```
you@cloudshell:~/cloudshell_open/terraform-budget-gcp$ terraform apply --auto-approve
```


**Important!!**
Once the above step completes successfully, perform the following command:
`./post-install.sh`

```
you@cloudshell:~/cloudshell_open/terraform-budget-gcp$ ./post-install.sh
```
- This will, in order, do the following;
  1. Set `run_post_install = true` in `terraform.tfvars`
  2. Enable `vault-config` module in file vault-config.tf
  3. Run `terraform init` to get plugins
  4. Run `terraform plan` to display proposed changes  

**Note:** It is possible to run these commands manually and skip the `./post-install.sh` script.  
This script just offers convenience.


Then run: 
 - `terraform apply --auto-approve` - to apply the infrastructure build
```
you@cloudshell:~/cloudshell_open/terraform-budget-gcp$ terraform apply --auto-approve
```
We do this in 2 steps because of some limitations in terraform that will cause an error if certain resources do not exist.

If you encounter any errors, try re-running the command  
`terraform apply --auto-approve`.  
It is safe to do so.
